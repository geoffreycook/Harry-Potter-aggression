```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

1. Load packages and read in data
```{r include = FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
hp_data <- read_csv("harry_potter_aggression_full.csv")

```

I'm saving HERRREEE!!! 

2. Do some basic wrangling and make a graph of Harry Potter and Draco Malphoy aggression rates

```{r}

hp_graph <- hp_data %>% 
  filter(Name == "Harry" | Name == "Draco Malfoy") %>% 
  select(Name, book, agg.per.mention) %>% 
  # Making a clustered column graph
  ggplot(aes(x = book, y = agg.per.mention)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = Name), position = "dodge") +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_bw()

hp_graph

```

This next sentence is for checking the staging and comitting of things and stuff.
